I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical Engineering Department at Yale University. I am a member of [Intelligent Computing Lab](https://intelligentcomputinglab.yale.edu), advised by Prof. [Priya Panda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qA5WsYUAAAAJ). 
My research interests include efficient deep learning models and systems and biology-inspired artificial intelligence. 
I have focused on neural network quantization for efficient inference, neuromorphic AI with spiking neural networks, and bio-plausible optimization methods. My research is applied to the lastest topics like Diffusion Models and Large Language Models. 

Prior to Yale, I graduated from UESTC in 2020. I did research assistant/internship at the National University of Singapore, SenseTime, and Amazon. I received the 2023 Baidu PhD Fellowship.
